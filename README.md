# COM_Port_popup
![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morrowsend/COM_Port_popup/morrowsend/COM_Port_Popup.PNG)

Python script that pops up the com port name when you plug it in.

1. Modify the batch file in notepad to have  the path to this python file

2. Then drop the batch file into your windows startup folder.

3. To find this folder, hit the windows key and type "run"  then in the box
type "shell:startup".  

4. When you plug in a COM port, it should automatically pop up with the name.

5. As it stands, this app only works for windows. I recommend taking a look at https://github.com/dhylands/usb-ser-mon for how to hack a linux.mac version together.
